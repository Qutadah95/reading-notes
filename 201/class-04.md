## Links

Links are the defining feature of the web because they allow you to move from one web page to another â€” enabling the very idea of browsing or surfing.
You will commonly come across the following types of links:
Links f
 *  rom one website to another
*  Links from one page to another on the same website
*  Links from one part of a web page to another part of the
same page
*  Links that open in a new browser window
* Links that start up your email program and address a new
email to someone


### Writing Links

Links are created using the <a> element. Users can click on anything
between the opening <a> tag and the closing </a> tag. You specify
which page you want to link to using the href attribute

  ### Key Concepts in Positioning Elements
  
  #### Building Blocks
  CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in itsown box. This box will either be a block-level
box or an inline box.
  
  Block-level elements
start on a new line
Examples include:
  
  * h1
  * p
  * ul
  * li

  
  Inline elements
flow in between
surrounding text
Examples include:


  * img
  * b
  * i
  

  
  
  
  ## WHAT IS A FUNCTION?
  
  Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a
specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can
reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of st atements).
