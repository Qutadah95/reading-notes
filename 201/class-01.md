### How People Access the Web ?

1. Browsers : People access websites using
software called a web browser.
Popular examples include
Firefox, Internet Explorer, Safari,
Chrome, and Opera.

2. Web Servers : When you ask your browser for
a web page, the request is sent
across the Internet to a special
computer known as a web
server which hosts the website

3. Screen readers : Screen readers are programs
that read out the contents of a
computer screen to a user. They
are commonly used by people
with visual impairments.

### How Websites Are Created ?
* Small websites are often written
just using HTML and CSS.

* Larger websites — in particular
those that are updated regularly
and use a content management
system (CMS), blogging tools, or
e-commerce software — often
make use of more complex
technologies on the web server,
but these technologies are
actually used to produce HTML
and CSS that is then sent to the
browser.
