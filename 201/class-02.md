## Summary structure

* HTML pages are text documents.
*  HTML uses tags (characters that sit inside angled
brackets) to give the information they surround special
meaning.
* Tags are often referred to as elements.
*  Tags usually come in pairs. The opening tag denotes
the start of a piece of content; the closing tag denotes
the end.
* Opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more
about the content of that element.
*  Attributes require a name and a value.
*  To learn HTML you need to know what tags are
available for you to use, what they do, and where they
can go.
 
#### When creating a web page, you add tags
(known as markup) to the contents of the
page. These tags provide extra meaning
and allow browsers to show users the
appropriate structure for the page.
In this chapter we focus on how to add markup to the text that
appears on your pages. You will learn about:

1-  Structural markup: the elements that you can use to
describe both headings and paragraphs


2-  Semantic markup: which provides extra information; such
as where emphasis is placed in a sentence, that something
you have written is a quotation (and who said it), the
meaning of acronyms.
