# Graphs

A graph is a non-linear data structure that can be looked at as a collection of vertices (or nodes) potentially connected by line segments named edges.

terminology used when working with Graphs:

1. Vertex 
2. Edge 
3. Neighbor 
4. Degree 

## we have two type of graphs : 

## Undirected Graphs 

An Undirected Graph is a graph where each edge is undirected or bi-directional. This means that the undirected graph does not move in any direction.

## directed Graphs

 Directed Graph also called a Digraph is a graph where every edge is directed.

 ## Complete vs Connected vs Disconnected

* Complete Graphs : A complete graph is when all nodes are connected to all other nodes.

* Connected : A connected graph is graph that has all of vertices/nodes have at least one edge.

* Disconnected : A disconnected graph is a graph where some vertices may not have edges.


## shapes

1. Acyclic Graph

2. Cyclic Graphs

## Graph Representation

1. Adjacency Matrix
2. Adjacency List

## Real World Uses of Graphs

* GPS and Mapping
* Driving Directions
* Social Networks
* Airline Traffic
* Netflix uses graphs for suggestions of products
