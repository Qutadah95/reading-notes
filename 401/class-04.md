# Object-Oriented Programming Concepts

## What Is an Object?

An object is a software bundle of related state and behavior


## What Is a Class?

A class is a  prototype from which objects are created.

## What Is Inheritance?

 it's the way to pass the information between parent and child

 ## What Is an Interface?
 
  An interface it is a bridge between a class and the outside world.

  ## What Is a Package?

A package is a namespace for organizing classes and interfaces in a logical manner. 

# Classes

the way to write a class in java : 

with out an object : 


public class Main {


  int x = 5;


}

with an object : 

public class Main {


  int x = 5;


  public static void main(String[] args) {


    Main myObj = new Main();


    System.out.println(myObj.x);


  }

}



# Binary, Decimal and Hexadecimal Numbers


## Decimals : 

its the number (0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9)

its contane thes 10 number as a basie 

Example: In binary you count "0,1,..." but then you run out of symbols!

So you add 1 on the left and then start again at 0: 10,11 ...


## Binary Numbers : 

its the number (0,1)

Binary Numbers are just "Base 2" instead of "Base 10". So you start counting at 0, then 1, then you run out of digits ... so you start back at 0 again, but increase the number on the left by 1.

## Hexadecimal Numbers : 

its the number (0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,A,B,C,D,E,F)
