# Trees

## Common Terminology

* Node - A Tree node is a component which may contain it’s own values, and references to other nodes
* Root - The root is the node at the beginning of the tree
* K - A number that specifies the maximum number of children any node may have in a k-ary tree. In a binary tree, k = 2.
* Left - A reference to one child node, in a binary tree
* Right - A reference to the other child node, in a binary tree
* Edge - The edge in a tree is the link between a parent and child node
* Leaf - A leaf is a node that does not have any children
* Height - The height of a tree is the number of edges from the root to the furthest leaf


## Traversals

There are two categories of traversals when it comes to trees:

1. Depth First

Here are three methods for depth first traversal:

* Pre-order: root >> left >> right
* In-order: left >> root >> right
* Post-order: left >> right >> root


2. Breadth First


## Binary Tree Vs K-ary Trees

Binary Tree : have a two of children left and right 

K-ary Trees : have a more then two child node and k is the number of the cild node


Breadth First Traversal : 
almost the same as the binary tree

## Adding a node

fill all “child” spots from the top down and from left to right.


Big O use big O (n) for space and time

## Binary Search Trees (BST)

type of tree that does have some structure attached to it.
