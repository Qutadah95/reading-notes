# Intro to Serverless

## What is Serverless Architecture? 

Serverless is a cloud computing execution model where the cloud provider dynamically manages the allocation and provisioning of servers

Serverless applications are event-driven cloud-based systems where application development rely solely on a combination of third-party services, client-side logic and cloud-hosted remote procedure calls (Functions as a Service).


## Here are some of the currently available cloud services:

* AWS Lambda
* Google Cloud Functions
* Azure Functions
* IBM OpenWhisk
* Alibaba Function Compute
* Iron Functions
* Auth0 Webtask
* Oracle Fn Project
* Kubeless

## Traditional vs. Serverless Architecture

advandege of Traditional : 

* Networking
* 3rd Party Dependencies
* Timeout
* Scale

advandege of Serverless Architecture : 

* Pricing
* Environments
* Scale

## Functions as a Service (FaaS)

FaaS is an implementation of Serverless architectures where engineers can deploy an individual function or a piece of business logic. 

Principles of FaaS:

* Complete management of servers
* Invocation based billing
* Event-driven and instantaneously scalable

## Key properties of FaaS:

1. Independent, server-side, logical functions
2. Stateless
3. Ephemeral
4. Event-triggered
5. Scalable by default
6. Fully managed by a Cloud vendor
7. The Serverless App

## Benefits of Serverless Architecture

1. From business perspective:

*  measured in milliseconds instead of hours.
* Process agility
* Cost of hiring backend infrastructure engineers goes down.
* Reduced operational costs

2. From developer perspective: 

* Reduced liability, no backend infrastructure to be responsible for.
* Zero system administration.
* Easier operational management.
* Fosters adoption of Nanoservices, Microservices, SOA Principles.
* Faster set up.
* Scalable, no need to worry about the number of concurrent requests.
* Monitoring out of the box.
* Fosters innovation.
