# First Timers Only

## You can do it! Here’s how.

* First contributions is a hands-on tutorial that walks you through contributions workflow on GitHub.
* https://up-for-grabs.net is a site that aggregates (rolls up and makes easy to explore) projects that actively want help.
* goodfirstissues.com is a site that aggregates the latest issues with the label “Good First Issue”, which is a GitHub feature for finding easy issues to tackle 
* goodfirstissue.dev curates easy pickings from popular open-source projects, and helps you make your first contribution to open-source.
* CodeTriage helps you subscribe to your favorite open-source projects and get a new open issue from them in your inbox every day.
* Read blog posts and guides on how to contribute to an open source project, then pick one!
* If you’re just getting started with tech and are planning to become a social developer, we’ve made a documentary training movie for you! 
* Wondering what someone else’s first contribution was? You can easily find out any GitHub usernames “First Pull Request” here!
* We think that open source projects should value civility, kindness, and patience with new developers


## Yes, it’s scary. But SO rewarding!

We asked folks on Twitter what they felt when they made their first contribution to an open source project. Here are just a few of their tweets.

Some had great experiences:

> @shanselman proud and excited. Added a feature to freecodecamp. Felt welcomed and wondered what else I was able 
> to do.

Some had bad experiences.

> @shanselman Can't remember the project, but it felt hostile, because I didn't know the contribution rules of the 
> project, and got remarks.

## Are you an OSS Project Owner?

If you are an OSS project owner, then consider marking a few open issues with the label first-timers-only. The first-timers-only label explicitly announces:

I’m willing to hold your hand so you can make your first PR. This issue is a bit easier than normal. And anyone who’s already contributed to open source isn’t allowed to touch this one!

## Empower a First Timer today!

We believe - and we hope you do too - that learning how to code, how to think, and how to contribute to open source can empower the next generation of coders and creators.
