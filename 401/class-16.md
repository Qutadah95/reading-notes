# Spring Boot and OAuth2

There are several samples building on each other, adding new features at each step:

1. simple
2. click
3. logout
4. two-providers
5. custom-error
You can run all the apps on the command line using mvn spring-boot:run or by building the jar file and running it with mvn package and java -jar target/*.jar (per the Spring Boot docs and other available documentation).

> $ cd simple
> $ ../mvnw package
> $ java -jar target/*.jar
