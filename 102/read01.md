# What is Markdown?
Markdown is a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document; formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown. Mostly, Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like # or *.

You can use Markdown most places around GitHub:

Comments in Issues and Pull Requests
Files with the .md or .markdown extension

we have some Syntax like :

1. Headers
# This is an <h1> tag
## This is an <h2> tag
###### This is an <h6> tag
  
  
2.Emphasis
*This text will be italic*
_This will also be italic_

**This text will be bold**
__This will also be bold__

_You **can** combine them_
  
  and another Syntax for more Syntax
