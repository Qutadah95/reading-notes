# Expressions and operators

### Operators
JavaScript has the following types of operators. This section describes the operators and contains information about operator precedence.

1. Assignment operators
2. Comparison operators
3. Arithmetic operators
4. Bitwise operators
5. Logical operators
6. String operators
7. Conditional (ternary) operator
8. Comma operator
9. Unary operators
10. Relational operators


### Assignment operators


An assignment operator assigns a value to its left operand based on the value of its right operand. The simple assignment operator is equal (=), which assigns the value of its right operand to its left operand. That is, x = y assigns the value of y to x.

### Return value and chaining


Like most expressions, assignments like x = y have a return value. 

### Comparison operators
A comparison operator compares its operands and returns a logical value based on whether the comparison is true.

### Arithmetic operators
 An arithmetic operator takes numerical values

 ### Bitwise operators
A bitwise operator treats their operands as a set of 32 bits (zeros and ones)

### Logical operators
Logical operators are typically used with Boolean (logical) values

### String operators
In addition to the comparison operators, which can be used on string values, the concatenation operator (+) concatenates two string values together, returning another string that is the union of the two operand strings

## Loops

Loops offer a quick and easy way to do something repeatedly. This chapter of the JavaScript Guide introduces the different iteration statements available to JavaScript.


### for statement
A for loop repeats until a specified condition evaluates to false. The JavaScript for loop is similar to the Java and C for loop.

A for statement looks as follows:

for ([initialExpression]; [conditionExpression]; [incrementExpression])
  statement

  ### do...while statement
The do...while statement repeats until a specified condition evaluates to false.

do

  statement

while (condition);

### while statement
A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to true. A while statement looks as follows

while (condition)

  statement
